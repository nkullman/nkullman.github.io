												<h2>Climate Change and the Deschutes National Forest</h2>
												<p>Seeking optimality in the face of uncertainty</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/deschutesNF.png" alt="" /></span>

											<p>The Deschutes National Forest offers recreation, clean air, a carbon sink, wildlife habitat, clean water, and countless other services.
												But it's also a severe wildfire waiting to happen.
												The Forest Service wants to curb this risk through fuels removal, but how do you it most effectively and with minimal impact to the forest and its provision of services? 
											</p>

											<h3>Forests and climate change</h3>
											<p>Similar to all other ecosystems, forests are predicted to undergo complex changes as a result of the changing climate:
												new spatial distributions of tree species, increased sediment delivery to streams, and increasing disturbance regimes such as wildfires, drought, and insect infestation.
												As this transformation occurs, forests’ ability to provide ecosystem services will change.
												For instance, increased frequency of wildfires will decrease forests’ ability to store carbon and provide habitat for wildlife.
												Increased sediment runoff to streams will hinder the ability to provide adequate water supplies to population centers.</p>
											<p>Our management of forests must evolve along with climate.
												Under new climatic conditions, practices that were once optimal will no longer be so.
												Without proper correction we will be managing forests in a way that restricts their potential.</p>
											<p>To determine new management practices we must first understand how climate change will impact forests’ ability to provide ecosystem services.
												How many tons of carbon dioxide will the forest be capable of storing?
												How many acres of forest will still qualify as suitable habitat for a particular species?
												Because forests provide these ecosystem services in concert with one another, we must also understand how climate impacts the tradeoffs that exist between them.
												When we look at the simultaneous provision of wildlife habitat, carbon storage, and resistance to wildfire, how does an increase in any one service alter our ability to acquire an amount of another?
												And how do these tradeoffs change as a function of climate?</p>
											<p>We're working with the Forest Service to answer these questions. Under a few of the key climate change scenarios, we'll determine the optimal management strategy for reducing fire hazard in the Deschutes National Forest.
												In the case of our study, an optimal management strategy is one that maximizes northern spotted owl habitat and minimizes fire hazard and sediment delivery to the watersheds.</p>

												<h2>Multi-objective optimization</h2>
												<p>Applications of the alpha-delta algorithm</p>
											</header>

											<span class="image featured"><img src="images/sanjuanriver.jpg" alt="" /></span>

											<p>The alpha-delta algorithm is in the family of methods used to find Pareto efficient solutions to multi-objective optimization models.
												(Others in this family include the epsilon-constraint method and weighted sums.)
												The first work I did with Sandor was writing an implementation of the alpha-delta algorithm.
												Given a CPLEX model file and a couple parameters, it finds the Pareto frontier of your n-objective LP or MIP model file.</p>
											<p>Below are short descriptions of a few projects whose models have been solved with the program.</p>

											<h3>Water allocation in the San Juan River</h3>
											<p>Fellow QERMie Will Chen<!-- add link --> is studying how water management at the dam on the San Juan River impacts water shortages in downstream communities, as well as native and nonnative fish populations.</p>
											<p>His multi-objective function is to minimize water shortage and nonnative fish populations and maximize native fish populations.
												Results aren't out yet, but you can see his complete model here.<!-- add link --></p>
												
											<h3>Ecological restoration in a Chile</h3>
											<p>UW SEFS alumni Trevor Walter is working with the Nature Conservancy to determine the best means of ecological restoration in a Chilean reserve marbled with nonnative eucalyptus plantations.</p>
											<p>He's seeking a means to restore the plantations to native forest cover while maximizing revenue and community engagement via employment in restoration activities.
												We're looking to publish the work soon, and when that happens we'll post a link here. In the meantime, you should check out the model.<!-- add link -->
											</p>
											
											<h3>Reducing fire hazard in the Deschutes National Forest</h3>
											<p>Before I started working on protecting the Deschutes National Forest, labmate Svetlana Kushch Schroder was working on it.</p>
											<p>With the US Forest Service, she established the primary objectives of protecting northern spotted owls, reducing fire hazard, and minimizing sediment delivery to the watersheds.
												This work (and more) can be seen in her dissertation<!-- add link -->, but the model alone can be found here<!-- add link -->.
											</p>
											
											<h3>Alpha-delta under construction</h3>
											<p>A redesign of the alpha-delta method is underway.
												You can check on the progress at the <a href="https://github.com/nkullman/AlphaDelta">Alpha-delta GitHub page</a>.
												Until the redesign is complete, the original implementation will still be in use. It wasn't hosted publicly, but I'm happy to share it.
												Interested in using it for your model? <a href="mailto:nick.kullman@gmail.com">Send me an email</a></p>
