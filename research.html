									<h2>Research <br><em>Multi-objective optimization</em></h2>
									<p>
										My research surrounds multi-objective optimization: developing models and the software to solve them and analyze the results.
										For my masters thesis, I am using optimization to study forest ecosystem services and their response to climate
										change. Read on to learn more.

									<h3>Climate Change and the Deschutes National Forest</h3>

											</span>
									<p>The Deschutes National Forest offers recreation, clean air, carbon storage, wildlife habitat, clean water, and countless
										other services. But it is also a severe wildfire waiting to happen, and climate change is not expected to improve
										matters. The Forest Service wants to curb this risk through fuels removal, but what schedule of treatments is most
										effective in consideration of climate uncertainties and with minimal impact to the forest and its provision of
										services? How does the answer change if we vary our assumption of climate change intensity?
									</p>

									<h4>Forests and climate change</h4>
									<p>Similar to all other ecosystems, forests are predicted to undergo complex changes as a result of the changing climate.
										A few of the changes include new spatial distributions of tree species, increased sediment delivery to streams,
										and increasing disturbance regimes such as wildfires, drought, and insect infestation. As this transformation occurs,
										forests’ ability to provide ecosystem services will change. For instance, increased frequency of wildfires will
										decrease forests’ ability to store carbon and provide habitat for wildlife. Increased sediment runoff to streams
										will hinder the ability to provide adequate water supplies to population centers.</p>
									<p>To mitigate the undesired changes, our management of forests must evolve alongside climate. What once were optimal
										practices may no longer be so. Without proper correction we will be managing forests in a way that restricts their
										potential.
									</p>
									<p>To determine new management practices we must first understand how climate change will impact forests’ ability to
										provide ecosystem services. How many tons of carbon dioxide will the forest be capable of storing? How many acres
										of forest will still qualify as suitable habitat for a particular species? Because forests provide these ecosystem
										services in concert with one another, we must also understand how climate impacts the trade-offs that exist among
										them. When we look at the simultaneous provision of wildlife habitat, carbon storage, and resistance to wildfire,
										how does an increase in any one service alter our ability to acquire an amount of another? And how do these trade-offs
										change as a function of climate?</p>
									<p>We are working with the Forest Service to answer these questions. Under a few climate change scenarios, we will
										determine the optimal management strategy for reducing fire hazard in the Deschutes National Forest while maximizing
										northern spotted owl habitat and preserving watershed health.</p>

									<h3>A single-objective model for HBI reduction in the Chugach National Forest</h3>
									<p>
										Our lab also recently started a project with folks in the Chugach National Forest. The objective is to reduce human-bear
										interactions (HBI) near their world class sockeye salmon fishery that draws more than 70,000 anglers over the course
										of a summer. The project is still in its early phases, so check back as we continue to develop the model.

									<h3>Solving models with the Alpha-Delta algorithm</h3>
									<p>The alpha-delta algorithm is in the family of methods used to find Pareto efficient solutions to multi-objective
										optimization models. (Others in this family include the epsilon-constraint method and weighted sums.) The algorithm
										finds optimal solutions by iteratively slicing the solution space with a tilted hyperplane.</p>
									<p>Early in my QERM career, I wrote an implementation of the alpha-delta algorithm using the Concert Technology Java
										API for IBM's CPLEX optimization engine. Given a model file and a couple of parameters, it finds the model's
										Pareto frontier.
									</p>
									<p>A few researchers beyond our lab have put it to use. Below are short descriptions of some of the projects whose
										models have been solved with the program.</p>

									<h4>Water allocation in the San Juan River <em>Will Chen</em></h4>
									<p>Fellow QERMie <a href="https://mathecology.wordpress.com/">Will Chen</a> is studying how water management at the
										dam on the San Juan River impacts fish populations in the river and water supplies for downstream communities.</p>
									<p>His model minimizes water shortage and nonnative fish populations while maximizing native fish populations.</p>

									<h4>Ecological restoration in Chile <em>Trevor Walter</em></h4>
									<p>UW SEFS alumni Trevor Walter is working with the Nature Conservancy to determine the best means of ecological restoration
										in a Chilean reserve that is marbled with nonnative eucalyptus plantations.</p>
									<p>Trevor is seeking a means to restore the plantations to native forest cover while maximizing revenue and promoting
										community engagement via employment in the restoration activities.

								<h3>Visualizing multi-objective optimization results</h3>
								<p>
									I built the Multi-Objective Optimization Visualization (MOO Viz) tool in an effort to better understand the solutions to
									multi-objective models. The tool is under development, but it currently boasts some interesting objective-conflict
									statistics, and many more features are just around the corner.
